This is the Server Repository for a Battle Royale Inspired game made using Classes, JavaFX, and 2D Arrays. It is one of my first coding projects that I think is worthy of showing others. 
It is not the best game on the planet. However, it has a very cool concept. 
You can play with as many people as you want, but there can only be one host and they need to use the Server Repository in order to host everyone.
Everyone else needs to use the ClientServer Repo.
Make sure the projects run on the same LAN network (Again, sorry for not using WiFi but I did try my best).

To Start: 
  Hit connect on the Server and wait for everyone else to connect. 
  Once everyone is connected to the same port, hit ready. 
  Once that is done, you will have started the game.

Rules: 
You are to eliminate other players using in game weapons that you can buy from the item shop. 
The Bullets bounce off of the map edges and the obstacles in the middle. 
There are multiple types of weapons, they each have a different shooting pattern. 
There are portals on the edges of the maps, you can travel through those portals or shoot through them to make the bullets teleport. 
There are also items that you can buy as powerups, I recommend you try them out yourself. 
There are also item drops that appear which might have weapons, items or some powerups.

Controls: 
W- Up 
A- Left 
S- Right 
D- Down

Note: I've changed some settings in the game (Respawn time and buying things) to speed up the process in order to test some things, however, you can easily change those settings. Have Fun!

Thanks!

This is the Server Repository for a Battle Royale Inspired game made using Classes, JavaFX, and 2D Arrays. It is a big coding project that I learned a lot from.

This game has a very cool concept.
You can play with as many people as you want, but there can only be one host and they need to use the Server Repository in order to host everyone.

I coded mathematical concepts such as derivatives and minimizing displacement through slope reduction in order to optimize bullet paths for their trajectory.

Everyone else needs to use the ClientServer Repo (It is in my public repos).
Make sure the projects run on the same LAN network.

To Start: 
  Hit connect on the Server and wait for everyone else to connect. 
  Once everyone is connected to the same port, hit ready. 
  Once that is done, you will have started the game.

Rules: 

- You are to eliminate other players using in game weapons that you can buy from the item shop.

- The Bullets bounce off of the map edges and the obstacles in the middle.

- There are multiple types of weapons, they each have a different shooting pattern.

- There are portals on the edges of the maps, you can travel through those portals or shoot through them to make the bullets teleport.

- There are also items that you can buy as powerups, I recommend you try them out yourself.

- There are also item drops that appear which might have weapons, items or some powerups.

- Factories generate money for you to buy items and weapons in game.

Remember, you need to eliminate everyone else to win.

This is also a good way to understand Latency, even if it exists for an instant. 


Controls: 
W- Up 
A- Left 
S- Right 
D- Down

Note: I've changed some settings in the game (Respawn time and buying things) to speed up the process in order to test some things, however, you can easily change those settings. Have Fun!
